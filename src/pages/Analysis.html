                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>The Palmer Penguin dataset is widely used in academic settings due to its variety and scope, making it a good tool for exploring different types of statistical analysis. The dataset includes seven different metrics that can be analyzed for various insights. This report focuses on the correlation between penguin Body Mass and Flipper Length. This analysis shows that Flipper Length can be used as a reliable predictor of penguin Body Mass, using the formula ùë¶ = 50.153ùë• ‚àí 5872.1 within acceptable levels of accuracy. However, these findings are preliminary, and further analysis could reveal an additional wealth of other connections within the dataset.</p>
                <h3>Data Set</h3>
                <p>In this report, we will be examining the "palmer-penguins" dataset, provided by Allison Horst, a data scientist and artist on GitHub. The data was collected from 07 - 09 by Dr. Kristen Gorman, while working with the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. This dataset includes three categorical variables. species, island, and sex, along with four numerical variables. culmen_length_mm, culmen_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g. Together, these variables form the palmer-penguins dataset, which is largely used in training and classroom settings due to its simplicity and variety of variable types.</p>
                <h3>Preliminary Analysis</h3>
                <p>If we take a look at each quartile of our measurement variables it reveals a significant range and variability, with body mass showing the highest variation. Flipper length and body mass display moderate variability, making them suitable predictors for a linear regression model. </p>

                <p>If we plot Flipper Length as our independent variable and Body Mass as our dependent variable, we can see a consistent pattern. The R¬≤ score of 0.76 indicates that approximately 76% of the variance in Body Mass can be explained by Flipper Length. After we plot the residuals, we find a relatively low Mean Residual of 0.06.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Further, The Standard Error is 393.34. Considering that the range of the dependent variable (Body Mass) is 6300, this Standard Error is relatively low, representing about 6.24% of the Body Mass range. This indicates that the model is reasonably accurate, making Flipper Length an acceptable predictor of Body Mass. This project serves as a good case study for the importance of using methods such as plotting and analyzing residuals to verify findings.</p>
